## 1. Create a Frontity Project

The first thing we are going to do is create a new Frontity project.

To do so, open up your terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to install your new project, and run this command:

```bash
npx frontity create `jsnation-frontity`
```

When the install process finishes, you will have a new sub-folder called `jsnation-frontity` containing your project’s code.

Start a development server to check that everything is working:

```bash
cd jsnation-frontity
npx frontity dev
```

> `npx` downloads an npm package to run just this one time and then removes it from your computer. [learn more](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b)

Now open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser (if it didn't open automatically) to see your first Frontity project. At the moment it's using the "starter theme" that comes with Frontity, i.e. @frontity/mars-theme, and it is connected to a test WordPress site (https://test.frontity.io).

The next step is to change the project’s settings to point to the REST API of our own website (https://app-5ec4037dc1ac18016c052959.closte.com) - yes, the URL is pretty ugly, but it's just for test purposes. 😀

- Open the file `frontity.settings.js` file. This file contains the configuration for the Frontity packages that you are using in your project.

- Change the value of the `api` field of the `@frontity/wp-source package`.

Replace this:
```js
state: {
  source: {
    api: "https://test.frontity.io/wp-json"
  }
}
```
With this:
```js
state: {
  source: {
    api: "https://app-5ec4037dc1ac18016c052959.closte.com/wp-json"
  }
}
```
Refresh the page browser to see all the posts on the website. This is content generated by the [WordPress Theme Unit Test](https://github.com/WPTT/theme-unit-test) which is useful for creating and designing traditional PHP based WordPress themes, but we will find it useful for our purposes too.

## 2. Create a custom theme from scratch

Instead of using the default starter theme (@frontity/mars-theme) we are going to create a new package for our theme's code.

To do so, stop the previous process (CONTROL + C), and then run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npx frontity create-package jsnation-theme
```

You will be asked what namespace to use. Since you are creating a theme, you can use `theme`.

When the process is complete you will have a new folder called `/packages/jsnation-theme`. This is where we will be doing most of our work to build the theme.

The first thing to do is to remove @frontity/mars-theme from your settings and replace it with jsnation-theme.

Remove the following from the file `frontity.settings.js`:

```js
{
  name: "@frontity/mars-theme",
  state: {
    theme: {
      menu: [
        ["Home", "/"],
        ["Nature", "/category/nature/"],
        ["Travel", "/category/travel/"],
        ["Japan", "/tag/japan/"],
        ["About Us", "/about-us/"]
      ],
      featured: {
        showOnList: false,
        showOnPost: false
      }
    }
  }
},
```

And replace it with:

```js
{
  "name": "jsnation-theme"
},
```

And then, run this command again:

```bash
npx frontity dev
```

## 3. Modify the first component

Let's start by modifying the `<Root>` component in the `/packages/jsnation-theme/src/index.js` file so that it returns a `<h1>` containing the text “Frontity Workshop”.

```jsx
// File: /packages/jsnation-theme/src/index.js

const Root = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Frontity Workshop</h1>
    </>
  );
};
```

The content in the browser should automatically update as we have changed a file within the `/packages` folder.

Now, let's move the <Root> component into its own file.

Create a new folder called `theme-files` inside `/packages/jsnation-theme/src`. This is where we will create all the component files for our theme. Then, inside `/packages/jsnation-theme/src/theme-files` create a new file called `index.js`.

Add the following code to the new file *(which we will henceforth refer to as the 'root component' file)*.

```jsx
// File: /packages/jsnation-theme/src/theme-files/index.js

import React from "react";

const Root = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Frontity Workshop</h1>
    </>
  );
};

export default Root;
```

We now need to import it into the file `/packages/jsnation-theme/src/index.js` which you can modify as follows:

```jsx
// File: /packages/jsnation-theme/src/index.js

import Root from "./theme-files";

const jsNationTheme = {
  name: "jsnation-theme",
  roots: {
    theme: Root
  },
  state: {
      theme: {}
  },
  actions: {
      theme: {}
  }
};

export default jsNationTheme
```

Save both files and check that everything is still working in the browser.

## 4. Connect it to the state

Let’s connect the `<Root>` component to the Frontity state using `connect`. This allows us to access data stored in the state.

We need to `import {connect} from "frontity"`, pass `state` as a prop to our component, and finally export the connected component.

Then we add a <p> element to our component to display the URL we are currently in using `state.router.link`.

```jsx
// File: /packages/jsnation-theme/src/theme-files/index.js

import React from "react";
import { connect } from "frontity";

const Root = ({ state }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Frontity Workshop</h1>
      <p>Current URL: {state.router.link}</p>
    </>
  );
};

export default connect(Root);
```
You can try with a URL like http://localhost:3000/hello-frontity and see how state.router.link changes.

## 5. Add a menu

Now let's create a `<Link>` component in a new file `link.js`:

```jsx
// File: /packages/jsnation-theme/src/theme-files/link.js

import React from "react";
import { connect } from "frontity";

const Link = ({ href, actions, children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <a
        href={href}
        onClick={event => {
          event.preventDefault();
          actions.router.set(href);
        }}
      >
        {children}
      </a>
    </div>
  );
};

export default connect(Link);
```

We now have to import the `Link` component into our `Root` component. Then we add a menu with three items.


```jsx
// File: /packages/jsnation-theme/src/theme-files/index.js

import Link from "./Link";

const Root = ({ state }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Frontity Workshop</h1>
      <p>Current URL: {state.router.link}</p>
      <nav>
        <Link href="/">Home</Link>
        <Link href="/page/2">More posts</Link>
        <Link href="/lorem-ipsum">Lorem Ipsum</Link>
      </nav>
    </>
  );
};
```

## 6. Use data from the current URL

In order to gain a better understanding of Frontity, let’s dig a little deeper and investigate how it works below the surface.

To do so, access `http://localhost:3000/lorem-ipsum/` in the browser and open the console. In the console type `frontity.state` to see the Frontity state. This is the same state that the components and actions have access to.

<p>
  <img alt="Frontity in the console" src="assets/console-1.png">
</p>

> Frontity uses [ES2015 Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy), so you have to open the property [[Target]] in order to see the state.

You will see Frontity's global state, including the general properties of your Frontity project. You can also see information about the `router`, including the `state.router.link` that we used earlier, and `source`, the package that connects Frontity to your WordPress site.

Let’s take a look at `state.source.data`. This is where the information for each URL is stored. If you inspect `/lorem-ipsum`, you can see that it’s a page, and that it has the ID 2452.

Specifically we are going to look at `state.source.data`. The information for each URL is stored there. If /informacion/faqwe inspect we can see that it is a page and has the ID 146.

<p>
  <img alt="Frontity in the console" src="assets/console-2.png" width="600">
</p>

With that information, we can access the data (title, content, etc) of that page with `state.source.page[146]`:

<p>
  <img alt="Frontity in the console" src="assets/console-3.png">
</p>

As you navigate from one URL to another, the package `@frontity/wp-source` automatically fetches everything you need and stores it in `state.source`.

If we open the Network tab (in the browser's devtools) and click on the menu to go to Home (Homepage), you will see that a call to the REST API is made to get the latest posts.

Take another look at `state.source.data`. You will notice that it's been populated with much more data than before.

Please note that instead of using `state.source.data[url]` it’s better to use `state.source.get(url)`. This ensures that URLs always include the final slash (/).

So now let’s inspect the homepage using state.source.get("/"):

<p>
  <img alt="Frontity in the console" src="assets/console-4.png" width="700">
</p>

As you can see, it has several interesting properties such as `isHome`, `isArchive`, and an array of `items`. If the homepage were a category it would have an `isCategory` property. If it were a post it would have a `isPost` property, etc...

To wrap up this section let's use all of this in our code.

For our next step we obtain the information about the current link (`state.router.link`) and use it to see if it’s a list, a post, or a page.

```jsx
// File: /packages/jsnation-theme/src/theme-files/index.js

const Root = ({ state }) => {
  const data = state.source.get(state.router.link);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Frontity Workshop</h1>
      <p>Current URL: {state.router.link}</p>
      <nav>
        <Link href="/">Home</Link>
        <Link href="/page/2">More posts</Link>
        <Link href="/lorem-ipsum">Lorem Ipsum</Link>
      </nav>
      <hr />
      <main>
        {data.isArchive && <div>This is a list</div>}
        {data.isPost && <div>This is a post</div>}
        {data.isPage && <div>This is a page</div>}
      </main>
    </>
  );
};
```

## 7. Display the list of posts

In order to display the list of posts, create a component called `<List>` in a new file `list.js`.  This will show the information in `state.source.data`, namely the `type`, `id` and `link` of each post.

```jsx
// File: /packages/jsnation-theme/src/theme-files/list.js

import React from "react";
import { connect } from "frontity";

const List = ({ state }) => {
  const data = state.source.get(state.router.link);

  return (
    <div>
      {data.items.map(item => {
        return (
          <div key={item.id}>
            {item.type} – {item.id} – {item.link}
          </div>
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
};

export default connect(List);
```

We need to import it into our root component and use it.

```jsx
// File:  /packages/jsnation-theme/src/theme-files/index.js

// ...
import List from "./List";

const Root = ({ state }) => {
  const data = state.source.get(state.router.link);

  return (
    <>
      {/* ... */}
      <main>
        {data.isArchive && <List />}
        {data.isPost && <div>This is a post</div>}
        {data.isPage && <div>This is a page</div>}
      </main>
    </>
  );
};
```

And now let's change the `<List>` component to use the information about each of the posts to show the title and turn it into a link.

```jsx
// File: /packages/jsnation-theme/src/theme-files/list.js

import  React  from  " react " ;
import { connect } from  " frontity " ;
import  Link  from  " ./Link " ;

const  List  = ({ state }) => {
   const  data  =  state.source.get(state.router.link );

  return (
    < div >
       { data.items.map( item => {
         const post = state.source.post[item.id]
         return (
           <Link key={item.id} href={post.link}>
              {post.title.rendered}
           </Link>
         );
      }) }
    </ div >
  );
};
```

## 8. Display the content of posts




## Add some style
## Use state and actions
## Add tags to the <head>
